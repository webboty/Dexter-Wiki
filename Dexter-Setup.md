## Unpack
Caution: When following the directions below to remove a Dexter from it's shipping / storage case, please be very careful to rotate each joint in the correct direction to unfold the arm and stand it up straight. This direction should be obvious for the base (joint1) and joints 2 and 3, but joints 4 and 5 can be rotated in the wrong direction and end up 360 degrees from the correct place. Pictures placed in the case when a new Dexter is sent out should indicate the correct directions, but you can also figure them out by looking at what the tool interface will run into as it's rotated. Just make sure the wires don't get wrapped up.

Normally, all that is required is rotating Joint 3, "the elbow" up to a straight vertical position.

## Mount

The top layer of the case will contain the base, remove it and place it with the feet down, and the center mounting pole up. The standard Dexter base is NOT intended to be perfectly stable. It must be mounted to a stable surface by gluing, screwing, or clamping the legs down. 
- If the surface has a lip, you can clamp 2 or 3 of the feet down.<br><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/419392/58844223-183edf00-862b-11e9-8197-37fc97029a21.png">
- For wooden, metal, or other surfaces which can have holes, screw or bolt the feet down.<br><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/419392/58844593-c5febd80-862c-11e9-9076-bd438fcaf95d.png">
- For a flat, inviolate surface like steel, marble, cement, etc... use large amounts of hot glue injected up into the bottom of each "foot"<br><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/419392/58844667-183fde80-862d-11e9-8bcc-aeaed5865306.png"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/419392/58922776-4dae0000-86f1-11e9-9b93-85de3b98551f.png">

## Assemble
Now remove the Dexter robot from the lower level of the case. Typically, you should grip it by the handel on Joint 3 aka "the elbow" (avoid gripping the side of joint 3 which has the belts) and by the external gear housing of Joint 2, "the shoulder" or by the base mounting column. Align the strake with holes in the base mount and slide it in. Tighten the base clamp. 

## Position
Before powering on Dexter, position each joint at a known position. The default position is with all the joints vertical, and the tool interface (the last segment) pointed to the right when facing the joints, as shown here:<br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfry/dde/master/doc/coor_images/Positive_Joint_Directions_J234.PNG">

Normally, when unpacking Dexter, all you should need to do is rotate Joint 3 in the direction shown by the arrow (clockwise, when facing the front) and make minor adjustments to the other joints. Each motor drive shaft has a small dial / handle to rotate it to a consistent position on startup. After the initial calibration, as long as the start position is within a degree or two of the previously calibrated position, no movement calibration should be necessary before switching to a close loop mode. For more on this, see [Encoder Calibration](Encoder-Calibration). DDE will walk you through initial calibration.

## Connect
Plug in the power cord to fire up your Dexter robot. Wait for the "boot dance" to complete (if it's enabled). Continue to [connect to Dexter](Dexter-Networking).

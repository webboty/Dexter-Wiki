# Dexter Development Environment

[DDE](https://github.com/HaddingtonDynamics/Dexter/blob/master/DDE/README.md) allows users to develop and run software on multiple platforms to control the Dexter 5 axis robot arm. 
It is fundamentally a JavaScript development environment with lots of extensions. See [DexRun-DDE-communications](DexRun-DDE-communications) for more detail about the communications between DDE and Dexter.

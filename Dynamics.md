Not much work has been done in terms of dynamics but some statics have been done...

### Center of Mass Measurements

The center of mass (CoM) has been measured for a Dexter and the results are shown below.
It should be noted that this particular Dexter may not match every Dexter and there features specific to it:
-Double base clamp (affects the link lengths and overall height of every z measurements)
-Bolted base instead of 6 legged aluminum strake base

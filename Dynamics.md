Not much work has been done in terms of dynamics but some statics have been done...

### Center of Mass Measurements

The center of mass (CoM) has been measured for a Dexter HDI and the results are shown below.<br>
It should be noted that this particular Dexter may not match every Dexter.
A couple of features specific to the Dexter HDI that was measured:<br>
-Double base clamp (affects the link lengths and overall height of every z measurements)<br>
-Bolted base instead of 6 legged aluminum strake base<br>
-End-Effector is not included<br>

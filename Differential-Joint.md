The HD version of the Differential Joint can be used on prior Dexter versions, and offers several advantages. The largest advantage is that the encoder disks fully encircle the joint, fused to the parts, and so are far more mechanically stable.

The STL files for printing are available:<br>

<br>But it should be noted that they are typically printed in the Onyx Carbon Fiber filament on a Markforged 3D printer. Other filaments should work, but won't be as strong. ABS is probably the best choice for commonly available materials. The part files are:
- DiffGearAxle
- AnglePhoto
- DiffBodyA
- DiffBodyB
- DiffEndPulley
- DiffGearShaftXL
- RotateCodeDisk
- RotatePhotoA
- RotatePhotoB
- SplitGearBottom
- SplitGearTop

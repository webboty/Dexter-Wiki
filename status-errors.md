Errors that occur on Dexter are communicated in the next returned packet.
- Most oplets will return a [status](status-data) with a standard error code (see list below)
- [Read From Robot](read-from-robot) and [Write To Robot](write-to-robot) as well as the [RunFile](set-parameter-oplet#RunFile) SetParameter command deal with file IO and so return the [standard Linux error numbers](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/asm-generic/errno-base.h) _and NOT any of the errors below_. E.g. an error code of 2 with an 'r' or 'W' oplet means there is "No such file or directory"; it does NOT mean "Bad Request". 
- The Monitor can override any of the above, replacing the status error with a number in the 600-699 range. In that case, it is possible that a prior error may be overwritten. E.g. If a monitor error occurs during a Read From Robot or Write To Robot which also generated an error, that error would be lost. Any such operation should be restarted once the monitor error is resolved. 

### Standard Dexter Error Codes
_Note: These do NOT apply to [Read From Robot](read-from-robot) and [Write To Robot](write-to-robot)_

 No | Description
--- | -------------------
 0  | **No error**
 1  | **Unknown** Most often returned when the requested oplet or sub command is not known. This is most likely to occur because the [firmware](Firmware) on the robot is out of date, and it should be [updated](../../Firmware#readme).
 2  | **Bad Request** The request was incorrectly formatted. In practice, this means there was no ';' at the end of the last socket data. Any other malformation is unlikely to be detected. 
 3? | **Firmware - Gateware Mismatch** The DexRun.c [firmware](Firmware) and xillydemo.bit [gateware](Gateware) files do not match. See [Issue 68](https://github.com/HaddingtonDynamics/Dexter/issues/68) for more information. _Note: This error code is not yet implemented_
665 | **Boundary error** A joint was commanded to move past the boundary set for it, [Read](read-from-robot) the errors.log file for details. There are high and low [boundary settings](set-parameter-oplet#JointBoundaries) for each joint: J#Boundry(High|Low). These are specified in the Defaults.make_ins file, or can be overridden via [SetParmeter](set-parameter-oplet) or the "b" [Oplet](Command-oplet-instruction)
666 | **Monitor error** Raw encoder position or velocity exceeded, [Read](read-from-robot) the errors.log file for details. If the error was velocity related, the robot will be switched into open loop mode from any closed loop mode under the assumption that the cause is a bad [encoder](Encoder-Calibration). There are [SetParmeter](set-parameter-oplet) settings for [RawEncoderErrorLimits](set-parameter-oplet#RawEncoderErrorLimits) and [RawVelocityLimits](set-parameter-oplet#RawVelocityLimits) 
+1024 | **FPGA - Firmware Mismatch** _proposed_ When the [INPUT_OFFSET in DexRun.c](https://github.com/HaddingtonDynamics/Dexter/search?q=INPUT_OFFSET&unscoped_q=INPUT_OFFSET) doesn't match the number of ports in the [FPGA's](Gateware) mapped address as specified in the [XILLYDEMO.BIT file](https://github.com/HaddingtonDynamics/Dexter/tree/master/Gateware), those two parts can't work together. In this case, rather than just shutting down, the firmware could "fake" a mapped memory array, and continue running. But no motion would be possible; only non-hardware commands can execute. e.g. [write_to_robot](oplet-write) for updating the files. We need to let the users know there is a continuing issue while still transmitting other error messages (such as an incorrect folder name when attempting to update firmware). To accomplish both, we add a value to all returned errors. If there is no error, we return 1024. If there is an error code of 1, we return 1025.

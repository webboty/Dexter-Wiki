Under the [microzed](MicroZed) board which hosts the [Xilinx FPGA](Gateware) and [ARM processor](Firmware), Dexter has a Motor / control board with stepper drivers to run the main [joints](Joints), 3.3V, 5V and 33V motor power regulators, and IO connections. This is a critical part of [Dexter's Hardware](Hardware)

To SSH into Dexter, you will need an [SSH client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients) (e.g. [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)). Configure the IP address in the client software to 192.168.1.142 (this is [Dexters default IP address](../../../wiki/Dexter-Networking)), set the port to 22, and select SSH.
